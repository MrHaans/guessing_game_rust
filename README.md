# Guessing Game in Rust

Welcome to the **Guessing Game**, a simple command-line project written in Rust! In this game, the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess the correct number by entering their guesses. The game will guide the player by indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. Itâ€™s a fun and interactive way to practice Rust programming concepts such as variables, input/output handling, loops, and error handling. The project is great for beginners who are looking to explore the basics of Rust and enjoy coding games!

## Features
- Generates a random number for each game session
- Provides feedback for each guess (too high, too low, or correct)
- Repeats until the player guesses the correct number
- Simple and interactive command-line interface

## Getting Started

To run the guessing game, make sure you have Rust installed. Clone this repository, navigate to the project folder, and execute:
